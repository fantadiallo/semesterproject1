A new interactive science museum, the Community Science Museum, is set to open in our town/city. It aims to engage primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum seeks a website that is informative and appealing, targeting middle school pupils and their parents. The site should be designed to attract youngsters without underestimating their intelligence. It should provide engaging content to encourage visits to the museum. The website must also be responsive, ensuring ease of use across various devices. Media assets including text and images are provided for creative implementation.

## Description


The semester project aims to demonstrate students' creative and technical competencies acquired during the first semester. This encompasses proficiency in design principles, project management, communication technology, and HTML/CSS development.
